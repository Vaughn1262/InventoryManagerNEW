# Overview

In this program I was trying to begin to learn the C++ language. I need to learn more about many different programming languages to be a proficient programmer. I thought about what I could do that was fun, useful, and achievable. I think that I learned a lot about the C++ programming language from this program.

I wrote a piece of software that is like an inventory managament system. It uses user input to add, drop, display contents, sell, display gold, and buy items. In its current state it is rather limited but the basis is there to make a much more advanced system that could be adapted into a game.

The reason I wrote this software was because I am a big fan of RPG's. A good inventory system is always required to have a good RPG. I wanted to see if I could make a system that was similar to any of those. I think I did a decent job, if I had more time I could make it much more advanced.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio community to develop the software and used Github as the source control.

I used the C++ programming language, the vector library, the iomanip library, and the iostream library. The vector library allows for the use of vectors which are kind of like arrays but they can be modified. The iomanip and iostream libraries are just for basic input and output. It helps with formatting and other functions that are useful.

# Future Work

- Add a GUI of some kind
